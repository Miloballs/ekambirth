i keep getting memories of when we did our catch the pedo case which was actually one of the funniest things I've ever done and i still laugh at it to this day (we got that hoe red handedüòºüòº) and then there's also our chav and emo days back at hargrave goodness me that was long ago. that still haunts me to this day and i don't think i will ever get away from the emo allegations since then ü§¨üò° PLSSSSS i miss our first staff eras together miss g aster and miss e kaycee-morris ate that school up (we didn't know what we were doing half the timeüò¨) AND THEN THERES ALSO THE ODD TIMES WITH TOM. plspssllsss that was honestly so hilarious in the weirdest way possible and i wish I had more screenshots of that ro teaching era between you two which i will agree was very odd on his end but it was still hilariousüòà to be honest we both actually need to touch grass i fear we are too addicted to robloxing whether it's pretending to be babies and sneaking into people's houses and trying to find a family OR going to restaurants and eating our big backs out üê∑üê∑üê∑ EITHER WAY THEYRE ALL HILARIOUS RAHHHHHH
